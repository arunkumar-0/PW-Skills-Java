1. What is an interface in Java?
Ans : It is similar to abstract class except the fact that whichever method will be written inside the interface will be abstract and public method by default.
By default the variables will be "public static final"
No constructor can be made of interface as it is incomplete class . 
Interface provide more sharability to java. 
Object of interface can not be made. 

2. Which modifiers are allowed for methods in an Interface?Explain with an example
Ans : for method only public and absract are allowed 
Example : 
interface A { 
    public void show ();
}
class B implements A {
    public void show (){
        System.out.println("inside interface ")
    }
}
class Interface {
    public static void main (String []args){
        B b = new B();
        b.show();   
    }
}

3. What is the use of interface in Java?
Ans : It provide more sharability to programs . 
It helps to achive full abstraction where we just want absract methods 
We can use multiple inheritance in java using Interface which is not possible with class 

4. What is the difference between abstract class and interface in Java?
Ans: class which have atleast one absract method is called abstract class whereas class having only abstract method is called interface
We can use multiple inheritance interface but not with abstract class 
inheritance with abstract class is used with "extends" keyword and inheritance with interface is possible with "implements" 
both interface and absract class can not have object 
abstract class can have constructor but interface can not have constructor . 
absract class can provide implementation of interface but interface cannot provide implementation of abstract class . 
absract class use absract keyword and interface uses the keyword interface 
absract class can have static , non-static , final , non-final variables and interface can only have static and final variables
