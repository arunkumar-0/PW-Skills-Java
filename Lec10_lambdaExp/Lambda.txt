1. What is the lambda expression of Java 8?
Ans: Lambda expression provide implementation of functional interface . It helps to reduce the code and help to create 
syntax : (parameter-list) -> {body}

It has 3 components : 
Argument-list : It can be empty or no-empty 
Arrow-token : It is used to link Argument-list and body of expression
Body: Expression and statements for lambda expression 

2. Can you pass lambda expressions to a method? When?
Ans : Yes, you can pass a lambda expression to a method provided it is expecting a functional interface. For
example, if a method is accepting a Runnable, Comparable or Comparator then you can pass a lambda
expression to it because all these are functional interfaces in Java 8.

3. What is the functional interface in Java 8?
Ans : If any java interfaceallow only one abstract method than it is functional interface . 
To make an interface fuctional interface then we have to use the following annotation @functionalInterface


4. What is the benefit of lambda expressions in Java 8?
Ans : It removes the code anonymous class which helps to write very less code and it provides implementation of functional interface.

5. Is it mandatory for a lambda expressio
Ans: No, it's not mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters, we can define a lambda expression
without parameter.
