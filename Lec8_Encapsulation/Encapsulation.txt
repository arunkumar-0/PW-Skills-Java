Q1. What is Encapsulation in Java ? Why is it called Data hiding ? 
Ans : Encapsulation is binding of data and methods into a single unit is called Encapsulation. If any class follow data hiding and abstraction then such class is referred as Encapsulated class .
It is called data hiding because with the help of Encapsulation we show only relevant data to the user and hiding rest of the data . It safeguard the data from the outside world .

Q2. what are inportant features of Encapsulation ? 
Ans : The important featured of Encapsulation are : 
1. We can achieve security by hiding the information 
2. Enhancement become easy 
3. Maintainability and Modularity become easy . 
4. It provide flexibility to the user to use system very easily . 


Q3. what are getter and setter methods in java Explain with an example ?
Ans : Getter and settter methods help to set and get data . getter helps in getting the value from the instance variable of the class whereas the setter set the value to the instance variable of the class 
we can directly create getter and setter by right clicking on IDE than souce actiona and finally clicking on generate getter and setter .


Q4. What is the use of this keyword explain with an example 
Ans : This keyword helps in overcomming the shadowing problem where intance variable and local variable have same name so , the preference is given to the local variable so , this keyword help the JVM to indentify that the particular variable belongs to the current object . 
example : 
class Demo {
    private int age ; 
    private String name ; 

    public void setData(int age){
        this.age = age 
    }
    public void setData1(String name){
        this.name = name 
    }
    public void show(){
        system.out.println("Name is " + name ) ;
        system.out.println("age is " + age ) ;
    }
}

public class ThisKeyword{
    public ststic void main (String[]args){
        Demo obj = New Demo();
        obj.setData(19);
        obj.setData1("Arun");
        obj.show();
    }
}

Q5. What are Advantages of Encapsulation ?
Ans : The Advantage of Encapsulation are :
1. I t provides safety by hiding the information which is not needed 
2. It improves Maintainability of the program 
3. It prevent other classs from accessing the private field .
4. the code is flexible and easy to change with the new requirements 


Q6. How to achieve Encapsulation in java ? give an example ?
Ans : Encapsulation is java is achieved by making the method or variable visibility as private so that they can only be accessed by that class only . The variables and methods cannot be accessed directly but they can be accessed indirectly . 

Example : 
class Demo { 
    private int age ; 
    private int cls ; 
    
    public void setData(int a , int b ){
       age = a ; 
       class = b; 
    }
    }
    public void show(){
        system.out.println("the age and class is " + age + cls );
    }
    public class Encapsulation { 
        public static void main (String [] args){
            Demo obj = New Demo();
            obj.setData(16 , 8);
            obj.show();
        }
    
}
