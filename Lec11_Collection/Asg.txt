1. What  is the Collection framework in Java?
Ans: Collection is a set of classs and interaces which help to store homogeneous as well as hetrogeneous data . 
 It is dynamic in nature 
 All the data stored in Collection is in the form of objects
 It implements using standard data structue so , ready made methods are available 

2. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
Ans:
ArrayList :  It is a dynamic array data structure 
Duplicates are allowed 
Insertion order is 
Insertion order is preserved through index 
Hetrogeneous objects are allowed 
null insertion is allowed 
It takes less memory 
the data is stored in continous form 
it is good for  storing and fetching the data 

LinkedList : 
Doubly linked list data structure is used 
It is good for manupulating the data 
the memory is not given in continous form 
LinkedList does not provide random access
duplicates are allowed 
null insertion is possible 

3. What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
Ans: Iterator : It is used to fetch the data while using the collection 
It is universal for all collections 
It can move is forward direction only .

ListIterator : It can traverse in both direction forward as well as backward . 
It can only be used with specific lists only i.e ArrayList and LinkedList 
ListIterator is child interace of Iterator.

4.  What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration?
Ans: Enumeration : we can use Enumeration to get objects one by one . 
To create Enumeration object we use element().
It is not a universal cursor 
It can perform only traverse operation 
It is faster 

Iterator : It is universal cursor for collection . 
It can move in forward direction only . 
It is slower the Enumeration. 
It perform perform remove operation while traversing 

5. What is the difference between List and Set?
Ans: List : It allows duplicates 
Multiple null elements are allowed
It implements ArrayList , LinkedList , Vector , Stack . 
Insertion order is preserved in the list 
The ListIterator() is used to iterate the list elements.
they can be accessed based on their position

Set : It does not allow duplicate values 
Insertion order is not preserved in set 
It implements Hashset , linked Hashset .
the are not indexed so, cannot access based on their position
only one null element can be stored at a time 
the Iterator() method is used to iterate the elements.

6. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
Ans:
HashSet : It uses Hash table to store data 
Duplicate values are not allowed 
The order of insertion is not preserved 
It is best for searching operation 
null insertion is possible
It is unordered collection 

TreeSet : It uses Binary Search tree to store data 
Order of insertion is not preserved 
It follows in-order traversal 
It is a ordered collection
Hetrogeneous elements are not allowed
null insertion possible only at once 

7. What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Ans:
Array : Array can store homogeneous data 
array have better performance than ArrayList
The size of array is fixe that means they are not dynamic
Array are mutable 
Array can be initialize at the time of declaration as well as later on.

ArrayList : 
ArrayList is used to store objects
They are dynamic in nature 
They hold homogeneous as well as hetrogeneous type of data 
they provide more method for manupulating the data 
ArrayList require method to add the data to the collection 
ArrayList are mutable 

8. What is a Map in Java?
Ans: It represents a group of individual objects as a key-value pair 
It helps to achieve uniqueness when we have similar typr of data 
The key must be unique and the value may or may not be unique

9. What are the commonly used implementations of Map in Java?
Ans: The commonly used implementations of Map in Java are HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap, and
ConcurrentHashMap.

10.  What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?
Ans: HashMap stores data in unordered collection while the TreeMap stores data in ordered collection.
The data structue used by HashMap is HashTable and the TreeMap uses natural ordering or custom comparitor.

11. How do you check if a key exists in a Map in Java?
Ans : We can use ContainKey() method or get() method
